# File Organization

## Mobile App Structure
```
apps/mobile/
  app/              # Expo Router pages
    (tabs)/         # Tab navigation screens
    _contexts/      # React Context providers
    _hooks/         # App-specific hooks
    _lib/           # App-specific utilities
    _components/    # App-specific components
  components/       # Reusable components
  hooks/            # Reusable hooks
  lib/              # Utilities
```

## Web App Structure
```
apps/web/src/
  app/              # Next.js App Router
    api/            # API routes (proxy to edge functions)
  components/       # React components
    ui/             # Shadcn/UI components
  hooks/            # Custom hooks
  lib/              # Utilities
```

## Shared Packages
```
packages/
  data/             # Supabase client, models, types
  features/         # Shared business logic
  ui/               # Cross-platform UI (if needed)
```

## Rules
- Platform-specific code stays in respective `apps/` directories
- Shared logic should live in `packages/`
- Use path aliases: `@data/*`, `@features/*`, `@ui/*`
- Test files: `__tests__/` directories

## Code Organization Best Practices
- [ ] Related code is grouped together
- [ ] Large components are broken into smaller pieces
- [ ] Reusable logic is extracted to hooks/utilities
- [ ] Constants are defined at the top of files
- [ ] Imports are organized (external, internal, relative)
- [ ] File names follow conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities)
