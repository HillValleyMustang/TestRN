## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- React Native development environment set up
- Expo CLI installed (if using Expo)
- Supabase credentials (already configured)
- Access to web app codebase for reference

### Phase 1 Kickoff Steps
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b mobile-redesign-phase-1`
2. Install Poppins font (expo-font or react-native-vector-icons)
3. Create `apps/mobile/constants/Theme.ts`
