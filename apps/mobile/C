# Constants Import Resolution Fix

## Issue Summary
Android bundling failed with the error:
```
Unable to resolve "../../../constants/Theme" from "apps/mobile/components/ui/Card.tsx"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem Identification
The issue was caused by **missing TypeScript configuration** for the `constants` directory. The error occurred because:

1. **Missing Directory Inclusion**: The `constants` directory was not included in the TypeScript `tsconfig.json` file's `include` array
2. **Module Resolution Failure**: Metro bundler (used by Expo) couldn't resolve imports from the `constants` directory because TypeScript wasn't configured to recognize these files
3. **Build-Time Error**: The bundling process failed during the module resolution phase before compilation

### File Structure Analysis
- **Card.tsx location**: `apps/mobile/components/ui/Card.tsx`
- **Theme.ts location**: `apps/mobile/constants/Theme.ts`
- **Import path**: `../../../constants/Theme` (correct relative path)
- **Export verification**: All required exports (`Colors`, `BorderRadius`, `Spacing`, `Shadows`) exist in Theme.ts

### Technical Details
The original `tsconfig.json` included:
```json
"include": [
  "./app/**/*",
  "./components/**/*", 
  "../../packages/**/*"
]
```

But was **missing** the constants directory, causing TypeScript and Metro bundler to ignore all files in `apps/mobile/constants/`.

## Solution Implementation

### Fix Applied
Updated `apps/mobile/tsconfig.json` to include the constants directory:

```json
"include": [
  "./app/**/*",
  "./components/**/*",
  "./constants/**/*",  // ← ADDED THIS LINE
  "../../packages/**/*"
]
```

### Why This Fixes The Issue
1. **TypeScript Recognition**: Now TypeScript compiler includes all files in the constants directory during type checking
2. **Metro Bundler Support**: Metro bundler can now resolve imports from the constants directory during the bundling process  
3. **Module Resolution**: Import statements like `import { Colors } from '../../../constants/Theme'` now resolve correctly

## Verification Steps

### Expected Result
After applying this fix and restarting the development server with `--clear` flag, the bundling should succeed and the import error should be resolved.

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Clear Metro cache and restart
cd apps/mobile
npx expo start --clear

# Or with npm script
npm run start -- --clear
```

## Prevention Measures

### Future Considerations
1. **Directory Structure**: When adding new directories with shared utilities/constants, ensure they're included in `tsconfig.json`
2. **Path Mapping**: Consider using path aliases in `tsconfig.json` for better import management:
   ```json
   "paths": {
     "@constants/*": ["./constants/*"]
   }
   ```
3. **CI/CD Checks**: Add TypeScript compilation checks to catch import resolution issues early

## Files Modified
- `apps/mobile/tsconfig.json` - Added `"./constants/**/*"` to include array

## Related Files (Unchanged)
- `apps/mobile/components/ui/Card.tsx` - Import statements were correct
- `apps/mobile/constants/Theme.ts` - All exports exist and are properly structured  
- `apps/mobile/constants/Typography.ts` - Export structure is correct

## Impact
- **Low Risk**: Configuration-only change, no code logic modified
- **High Impact**: Resolves critical bundling failure preventing app compilation
- **Scope**: Fixes all constants import issues across the mobile app

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - TypeScript configuration updated to include constants directory
